// LF normalization keeps the pin stable across Windows and CI.//
// 2026-10-05, health check (doer sec-h): migration 24
// (`migration-24-health-check.ts`, new, pinned here) adds three tables, `row_fingerprints`, `fp_dirty`
// and `set_aside`, and 51 triggers that queue changed rows of 17 tables into `fp_dirty`;
// `row-fingerprints.ts` (new, pinned here) holds the covered columns and their spec version, so a
// column added later is a deliberate bump. ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: no existing table or column
// changes, an older build refuses the database only through its existing unknown-migration check, and
// existing rows are simply "not yet fingerprinted" until a scan adopts them after unlock. No new
// SCHEMA_BUMPS entry, same as migrations 9 to 17. `database.ts` is not pinned, but note its change:
// `statement().run` now returns SQLite's own `changes()` because Bun's `changes` counts trigger writes.
//
// Previously:
//
// 2026-09-30, S4b: migration 19, its own file for the same
// line-cap reason as migration 18 (migration-18-parts.ts), added rather than folded into migration 18
// - 18 (S4a) was already reported SHIPPABLE this same day and may reach a reviewer's sandbox or
// Backstage before S4b does, and migrations never re-run an id once applied (sqlite/database.ts), so
// editing 18's SQL after it ran anywhere would leave two databases both marked "migration 18 done"
// with different schemas. INCOMPATIBLE in the same sense migration 18 already was: a part's large
// media and escrow strings move out of `piece_parts.cell` into two new tables, `blobs` (one sealed row
// per content hash) and `blob_refs` (which part rows reference which blob), additive on top of
// `piece_parts` and not read by any pre-S4b build - same unreleased, pre-export window as migration 18,
// no separate SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. `piece-part-text.ts` is DELETED: it existed only to carry S4a's
// temporary inline blob section (`decompose`'s extracted bytes travelling inside the same sealed cell
// as the part that referenced them, since no blob table existed yet); once blobs have their own
// tables, a part's wire text is exactly its sentinel-bearing json with nothing appended, so the
// length-prefix framing that module existed for has nothing left to frame. `piece-parts-sql.ts` gained
// `blob_refs` CRUD tied to each part row's own lifecycle (linked on insert, copied on restore via one
// set-based join, collected-then-swept on prune and purge); `blob-sql.ts` (new) owns the `blobs`
// table's own sealed-cell CRUD, keyed by `cipher.index(sha)` rather than the plain content hash so two
// libraries holding the same public image never show the same value on disk.
//
// Previously:
// 2026-10-01, replayed onto the cleaned Backstage history: the storage chain (migrations 18 and 19,
// patch saves) now sits on top of the 2026-09-30 bug 6 change (LorebookBody gained an optional
// `vectorizedRecursion` boolean beside `globalRecursion`, read by both recursion.ts and wake.ts;
// additive and COMPATIBLE, absent means true). The hash below covers both.
//
// 2026-09-30, S4a: migration 18, now held in its own file (migration-18-parts.ts) since migrations.ts
// would otherwise pass the line cap; both pinned here, along with the two new files that define the
// rest of the on-disk shape it introduces. INCOMPATIBLE, deliberately: `documents`,
// `document_versions`, `document_graves`, `grave_versions`, `document_summaries`, and
// `grave_summaries` lose `body_json` (a piece's body is now named part rows in the new `piece_parts`
// table, version ranges instead of one whole cell per version); the six old tables' rows are copied
// into plain `legacy_*_v17` tables first, kept on disk, never read. SQL cannot split an already-sealed
// `body_json` cell, so there is no converter: export before this lands and re-import after, losing piece version
// history, the Trash's contents, and version numbers (ids stay retired either way). Same kind of
// change as migrations 6 and 7, in the same unreleased v0.1.42 under the existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry
// (`src/ui/_shared/switch-decision.ts`): no new entry, because no release has shipped between them.
// `document-backend.ts` changed throughout: every method that touched `body_json` now reads or writes
// parts instead, through `sqlite/piece-parts-sql.ts` (new: the part cell's physical framing - the
// doc key and part name ahead of the opaque wire text, so a cell copied onto another row's part is
// caught on open) and `piece-part-text.ts` (new: that opaque text's own shape, a part's json plus the
// blob payloads its sentinels reference, since no blob table exists yet - S4b).
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 17: two new tables, `document_summaries` and `grave_summaries`, plus a backfill (`INSERT OR
// IGNORE ... SELECT`) giving every document and grave that already existed a placeholder "not
// computed" summary row, so an already-migrated library's pieces are reported as owed a rebuild
// instead of silently missing from `summaries()`'s join. Nothing existing rewritten.
// document-backend.ts changed alongside it to write, move, and read them atomically with the row they
// describe. Same kind of change as migration 16 (additive, no existing row shape moved), in the same
// unreleased v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 16: two added nullable columns on chats and one new table
// (scene_folders), nothing existing rewritten. Same kind of change as migration 9, in the same
// unreleased v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 15 (ChatStore rule 22: a take's latest committed reply's request text): one
// added nullable column on branches, nothing rewritten. Same kind of change as migration 9, in the
// same unreleased v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 14 (ChatStore rule 21: which registered Props a scene has switched on): one
// added nullable column, nothing rewritten. Same kind of change as migration 9, in the same
// unreleased v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 13 (ChatStore rule 20: the library books a scene added to itself, and the
// books switched off for it): one added nullable column, nothing rewritten. Same kind of change as
// migration 9, in the same unreleased v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 12 (ChatStore rule 19: the library preset a scene follows, its toggles, and
// its sampler overrides): one added nullable column, nothing rewritten. Same kind of change as
// migration 9, in the same unreleased v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 11 (ChatStore rule 18: the connection and model a scene last used): one added
// nullable column, nothing rewritten. Same kind of change as migration 9, in the same unreleased
// v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 10 (ChatStore rules 15 to 17: turn checkpoints, stored traces, branch
// variables, with each checkpoint's base version): three new tables, nothing existing changed. Same kind of change as migration 9, in the
// same unreleased v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for migration 9 (ChatStore rules 11 to 13: cut messages, deleted takes, recasting): seven
// added nullable columns, nothing rewritten. An older build refuses a database carrying a migration it
// does not know, so this is the same kind of change as migrations 6 to 8, in the same unreleased
// v0.1.42 under its existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated, compatible: the StateStore key check moved from the memory backend into the contract so
// both backends share it (the D18 boundary). Same keys, same stored bytes; no bump.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for retired ids (migration 8, spec behavior 10): deleting retires an id for good, so no
// new piece can take it and inherit what pointed at the old one; restore always comes home. Same
// unreleased v0.1.42 and the same SCHEMA_BUMPS entry as the two entries below; no new entry.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for the second half of the same INCOMPATIBLE move (plan phase 1 step two): the Studio's
// pieces left the file seam for the versioned documents store (migration 6: live rows and graves),
// and its own documents for studio_state (migration 7, which drops studio_files). It ships in the
// same unreleased v0.1.42 as the move into library.db, so the existing SCHEMA_BUMPS entry already
// routes any rollback across it through the backup gate; no new entry. The pinned files follow the
// storage: the file seam's backend is gone, the documents and state backends join.
//
// Previously:
// Updated for an INCOMPATIBLE change of storage medium: the
// library moved from plain files into the encrypted library.db. An older build would read the
// stale plain folder and never see anything written since, so this takes a SCHEMA_BUMPS entry
// (v0.1.42, the first release after v0.1.41 that can carry it) and the database's migrations and
// the Studio's storage and Kit's transcripts in it join the pinned files, so the next storage change
// is caught too.
//
// Previously:
// Updated deliberately for a NEW ENTITY KIND plus one additive field: `quickreply` (SillyTavern
// QuickReply sets as pieces, so a preset can link them and the Press prints them together) joins
// the union as a new member - the count above goes 8 to 9 with its own runtime-schema.ts - and
// PresetBody gains optional `quickReplyRefs`, the exact counterpart of `behaviorRefs`. Both are
// additive and COMPATIBLE: nothing previously valid becomes invalid, and a preset saved before the
// field existed parses byte-for-byte as it did. No schema-version bump, no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry.
//
// Previously updated for a COMPATIBLE WIDENING, in-flight on the working tree: PromptRole gained
// "tool" (preset/schema.ts, its runtime schema, and the blocks capability's mirror). Additive union
// member - every preset written before parses byte-for-byte as it did, and nothing previously valid
// becomes invalid; a NARROWING would be the incompatible direction. No schema-version bump and no
// SCHEMA_BUMPS entry.
//
// Previously updated for a NEW ENTITY KIND: `htmldoc`, an HTML document kept as a piece so the
// existing rename/duplicate/delete/collection tools have something to act on. Additive and
// COMPATIBLE - no existing kind's on-disk shape moved, and nothing previously valid becomes
// invalid, because the discriminated union only gained a member. A file written before this exists
// parses byte-for-byte as it did. No schema-version bump and no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; the count above
// went 7 to 8 because the new kind brought its own runtime-schema.ts.
//
// Previously updated for TWO COMPATIBLE changes that landed either side of this merge.
//
// From the archive-import branch: core/canonical.ts gained `primaryOriginalId`, a standalone
// function reading the same `Original` record `primaryOriginalRaw` already reads (the KEY of its
// first entry rather than the `raw` value). No interface changed and nothing about a PERSISTED
// entity's on-disk shape moved - new code reading the existing shape, not a shape change.
//
// From Mainstage: PresetBody gained an optional `behaviorRefs` string array, the exact counterpart
// of CharacterBody.behaviorRefs. Optional and additive, so a preset saved before it existed parses
// byte-for-byte as it did, and nothing writes the key unless a set is actually linked.
//
// Neither needs a schema-version bump and neither takes a SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The hash below is
// recomputed for the merged tree: the two pinned values from either side each describe only half
// of it, so keeping either one would have been a green tripwire guarding the wrong shape.
//
// The prior entry, also compatible: the canonical envelope gained an optional `notes` array,
// declared once on the shared envelope so every entity kind carries it. Removing the last note
// deletes the key rather than leaving `[]`, so an annotated piece and a never-annotated one still
// serialize identically.
//
// And before that: PresetSamplers.promptPostProcessing gained the values SillyTavern actually
// writes, and the per-group schemas were exported for the ST codec to read expected types off them.
//
// 2026-09-30, perf step 3.3 (commit 404e10d): sqlite/document-backend.ts gained READ paths only:
// summaries() left-joins documents so a row without a summary still lists, plus documentVersions,
// graveSummaries, counts and summaryGaps. No table, column, migration or write changed, so no
// schema bump. That commit landed without re-pinning this hash; this is the deliberate re-pin.
// 2026-10-02: migrations 20-23 add derived projections, autosave history, versioned frozen-cast
// parts, and accepted piece-change receipts. Pin each migration explicitly plus the integrated
// document backend. These extend the same unreleased v0.1.42 storage move covered by its existing
// SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; older builds refuse unknown migration ids and rollback still uses that gate.
//
// 2026-10-04: two compatible edits to pinned files landed without a re-pin. (1) sqlite/*.ts import
// DamagedDataError from stage/damaged-data-error instead of crypto/crypto (e4e480e5): an import path, no
// table, column or encoding change. (2) studio/settings-shape.ts: the stored `theme` setting now also accepts
// an imported theme's validated bunzai.theme.<slug> package id beside paper, stage and theater (0d833f26).
// A build that predates it drops an id it does not know and falls back to its default, so no schema bump and
// no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry.
//
// 2026-10-05: studio/settings-shape.ts gained one comment line (theme-key-ok, for the scan:theme-keys guard) on
// isStudioTheme. Comment only: no stored value, type or decoder changed, so no schema bump.
//
// 2026-10-05: studio/settings-shape.ts: the stored `theme` setting also accepts the new bundled id `greenroom` (the
// RoleCall theme), and a studio with no saved theme now paints it (DEFAULT_STUDIO_THEME) instead of theater. A saved value
// is never rewritten. A build that predates it drops an id it does not know and falls back to its own default, the same
// path as the imported-theme id above, so no schema bump and no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry.
//
// 2026-10-05, Cast wing, merged on top of Backstage's migration 24 (the health check): migration 25 adds two nullable
// columns, messages.persona_json (ChatStore rule 26: the sealed persona stamp on a user message) and chats.variant_id
// (rule 27: the scene's chosen alt-art variant); migration 26 adds the persona counters (rule 28): the sealed
// persona_stats table and chats.stats_state (0 = waits for the one-time backfill, 1 = counted live). The persona entity
// gained two optional presentation fields, emoji and signatureName (entities/persona schema and runtime-schema; the
// rolecall codec reads and writes them), and the new columns are covered by the health check's fingerprints. The pin was
// recomputed after the merge. All additive, so no new SCHEMA_BUMPS entry; same unreleased v0.1.42 move as above.
//
// 2026-10-05, chat import (ChatStore rule 30: copy RoleCall's hidden message): migration 27 adds
// messages.hidden (INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0), a plain flag; row-fingerprints.ts covers it (messages spec v3, so a v2
// fingerprint is adopted, not flagged). Additive and compatible: no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
//
// 2026-10-05, Continue (ChatStore rule 31, turn-loop rule 13): migration 28 rebuilds turn_checkpoints so its kind check
// also allows 'continue' (same columns, same row-fingerprint triggers, open checkpoints carried over). Compatible: a
// checkpoint row is transient, a build that predates it never writes 'continue', and no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
//
// 2026-10-06, ST templates (merged after migrations 27 and 28, which were already pinned): the pin now also covers
// (1) PresetBody gained two optional fields, samplerSet ("kobold" | "textgen" | "novelai") and reasoning
// ({ prefix, suffix, separator }); (2) a new entity kind, promptformat (entities/promptformat/runtime-schema.ts, body
// { name, instruct?, context?, notes? }), so the runtime-schema count goes 9 to 10; (3) the entities/runtime-schema.ts
// union gained that member. All additive: a preset saved before
// parses as it did and a build that predates the kind never lists its folder, so no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. Recomputed.
// 2026-10-06, remove one version (ChatStore rule 32: never hard-delete user content): migration 29
// (migration-29-swipe-cut.ts, new, pinned here) adds swipes.cut_at (INTEGER, null while the version is live), a plain
// time like messages.cut_at; positions are never renumbered. row-fingerprints.ts covers it (swipes spec v2, so a v1
// fingerprint is adopted, not flagged). Additive and compatible: an older build would show a removed version again
// (it ignores the column) but loses nothing; no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed. It was also red before this
// change: the runtime-schema count below stood at 9 while src/entities/quickreply/runtime-schema.ts (13e55278) makes it
// 10, so the count is corrected to 10 here and the hash now includes that file's text.
// 2026-10-07, one scene per chat source (ChatStore rule 33): migration 30 (`migration-30-chat-source.ts`, new, pinned
// here) adds the nullable `chats.import_key` and a partial index, and `row-fingerprints.ts` covers it (chats spec v3).
// ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null, an older build ignores the column. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry.
// 2026-10-09, the opening-message edit (ChatStore rule 34): migration 31 (migration-31-opening.ts, new, pinned
// here) adds the sealed nullable chats.opening_json, and row-fingerprints.ts covers it (chats spec v4, so a v3 fingerprint is
// adopted, not flagged). ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null, an older build ignores the column. No SCHEMA_BUMPS
// entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-09, the Prompting wing (ChatStore rule 37): migration 32 (migration-32-prompting.ts, new, pinned here) adds the sealed
// nullable chats.prompting_json (guides switched on, scene note), and row-fingerprints.ts covers it (chats spec v5). ADDITIVE and
// COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null, an older build ignores the column. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-09, scene backdrops (ChatStore rule 36): migration 33 (migration-33-backdrop.ts, new, pinned here) adds the sealed
// nullable chats.backdrop_json (a pack, an item and the overlay dim), and row-fingerprints.ts covers it (chats spec v6). ADDITIVE and
// COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null, an older build ignores the column. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-09, big Sprite packs (patch cache keeps pictures as references): piece-parts-sql.ts links a part's reference-only
// blobs (PartText.refs) to their existing blob rows in the write's own transaction and sweeps the blobs a replaced autosave
// row freed only after the new rows have linked theirs. NO stored shape changes: the same piece_parts and blob_refs rows hold
// the same bytes, a reader of either build sees the same piece, and no migration or SCHEMA_BUMPS entry is needed. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-11, cross-entry boosting (World wing): LorebookEntry gained two optional fields, boostIds (string array) and boostAmount
// (number), in entities/lorebook schema and runtime-schema; the activation engine reads them (engine/boosting.ts). ADDITIVE and
// COMPATIBLE: absent unless authored, so every stored book still parses and no migration runs. A build from before this one has a
// strict entry schema and would refuse a book that uses them, the same one-way edge as every optional field added above; no
// SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-11, the Compendium (ChatStore rules 38 and 39): migration 34 (migration-34-compendium.ts, new, pinned here) adds the
// sealed nullable chats.compendium_json (the scene's sparse Compendium choices), and row-fingerprints.ts covers it (chats spec
// v7); migration 35 (migration-35-receipts.ts, new, pinned here) adds the compendium_receipts table (readable ids, take,
// message, kind, status and times; one sealed cell for writes, model and reason; it cascades with its scene and has no
// single-row delete). ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null and the new table starts empty, an older build ignores
// the column and the table. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-11, merge of the two changes above: both are additive; the pin covers both and was recomputed.
// 2026-10-11, the Compendium's model-built tree (ChatStore rule 40, doer comp-ingest): migration 36 (migration-36-trees.ts, new,
// pinned here) adds the compendium_trees table (readable ids, book, status and time; one sealed cell holding the layout; it cascades
// with its scene, and Undo marks a row undone instead of deleting it). ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: the new table starts empty and an
// older build ignores it. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-11, the Cast wing's participant roster (ChatStore rule 41, doer cast-participants): migration 37 (migration-37-participants.ts,
// new, pinned here) adds the sealed nullable chats.participants_json (the scene's stored participants: NPCs, and overrides for the
// card and the player), and row-fingerprints.ts covers it (chats spec v8, so a v7 fingerprint is adopted, not flagged). ADDITIVE and
// COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null, an older build ignores the column. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-12, regex in scenes (ChatStore rule 42, doer scene-regex): migration 38 (migration-38-scene-regex.ts, new, pinned here) adds the
// sealed nullable chats.regex_json (the regex sets a scene has switched on, later also its preset choice answers), and row-fingerprints.ts
// covers it (chats spec v9, so a v8 fingerprint is adopted, not flagged). ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null, an older
// build ignores the column. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-12, tracker Props (ChatStore rule 43, doer props-wing): migration 39 (migration-39-trackers.ts, new, pinned here) adds the
// sealed nullable chats.trackers_json (what a scene's tracker Props remember: Stats first), and row-fingerprints.ts covers it (chats spec
// v10, so a v9 fingerprint is adopted, not flagged). ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null, an older build ignores the
// column. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-12, Final Cut in scenes (ChatStore rule 44, doer finalcut-branches): migration 40 (migration-40-final-cut.ts, new, pinned here) adds the
// sealed nullable chats.final_cut_json (the scene's Final Cut switch, passes and per-tool overrides), and row-fingerprints.ts covers it (chats
// spec v11, so a v10 fingerprint is adopted, not flagged). ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: existing rows
// carry null, an older build ignores the columns. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-12, the chat summary (ChatStore rule 45, doer context-wing): migration 41 (migration-41-scene-summary.ts, new, pinned here) adds the sealed nullable chats.summary_json (the scene's summary
// settings, its last automatic run's failure, and one text per take), and row-fingerprints.ts covers it (chats spec v12, so a v11 fingerprint is adopted, not flagged). ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE:
// existing rows carry null, an older build ignores the column. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed once for the merge of Backstage (migrations 39 to 41 together).
// 2026-10-12, the Story Director (ChatStore rule 47, doer director-engine): migration 42 (migration-42-director.ts, new, pinned here) adds the sealed nullable chats.director_json (the scene's Director settings) and the sealed
// director_states table (one story-state snapshot per version of a reply, keyed and cascaded like swipe_traces), and row-fingerprints.ts covers the chats column (chats spec v13, so a v12 fingerprint is adopted, not flagged).
// ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: existing rows carry null and the table starts empty; an older build ignores both. The table also joins the health check (row_fingerprints spec, the three fp_ triggers in the same migration, cell and structure scans). No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed twice.
// Comment-only edits to migrations.ts and migration-18-parts.ts (stale plan pointers removed) changed the pinned text, not the shape; the pin was recomputed again.
// 2026-10-26, the dock overlay (always open on launch): settings-shape.ts drops the `dockSlim` key name ("shell.dockSlim"); hiding the dock
// is now session-only. COMPATIBLE: parseSettings keeps unknown keys, so a saved "shell.dockSlim" stays on disk untouched and is simply
// not read; an older build still reads it. No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-26, Messenger settings and accessibility: settings-shape.ts adds four key names, "scenes.characterDefaults" (a new scene's
// starting setup per character) and "ui.textSize", "ui.reduceMotion", "ui.highContrast". ADDITIVE and COMPATIBLE: unset keys read as
// their defaults and an older build keeps them as unknown keys. No migration, no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-26, Stage lights (Settings > Appearance): settings-shape.ts adds the key name "ui.stageLights" and the value set moving | still | off; parseSettings drops any other value. ADDITIVE and
// COMPATIBLE: an unset key reads as moving and an older build keeps it as an unknown key. No migration, no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-26, the kind hub: each kind's whole-entity decoder moved from src/entities/runtime-schema.ts into its own runtime-schema.ts
// (built from the shared envelope, now src/entities/_shared/envelope.ts, pinned here), and the parse boundary unions the generated
// list src/generated/kind-schemas.ts (pinned here). NO SHAPE CHANGE: the same envelope fields, the same nine kinds, the same body
// decoders; the canonical round-trip tests pass unchanged. No migration, no SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-27, Script Sheets (RoleCall's single-instruction preset): the preset body gains an optional `scriptSheet: { version: 1, content }`. ADDITIVE: every
// stored preset without it parses as before. The decoder checks only its shape and the 100,000-character cap; the content rules are checked where a
// sheet is written and when it is sent (core/preset/script-sheet.ts), so a later rule change never makes a stored sheet unreadable. ONE-WAY: a build
// from before this change has a strict preset body and refuses a preset that carries `scriptSheet`.
// 2026-10-27 (later), the writing family: the Script Sheet becomes its own kind (src/entities/scriptsheet/, a new decoder:
// name, content, description, samplers) and the preset body drops the `scriptSheet` field it briefly carried, so a
// preset is stored exactly as before that field. A scene's preset choice gains its writing kind (`ChatPreset.kind`, rule
// 19, required; Bunzai has no stored scenes to carry). No migration: there is no data to keep.
// 2026-10-27 (later still), tools: a new kind (src/entities/tool/, a new decoder: name, description, typed fields with unique
// choices, and one action: roll the dice a text field names, roll a linked dice piece by id, or record; no code) and a scene's
// prompting gains `tools`, the library tools it links (ids, at most 20). ADDITIVE: every
// stored piece and scene reads as before. ONE-WAY: an older build has no tool kind and refuses prompting that carries `tools`.
// 2026-10-27 (last), dice: a new kind (src/entities/dice/, a new decoder: one type of roll, table or pool, carrying only that
// type's field, its dice and pool within the dice limits). ADDITIVE. ONE-WAY: an older build has no dice kind.
// Formulas: a new kind (src/entities/formula/, a new decoder: name, description, macro text up to 20,000 characters, shape only),
// and a tool action `formula` linking one by id. ADDITIVE. ONE-WAY: an older build has neither.
// 2026-10-27, no shape change: the dice, formula and tool decoders share one name and description shape
// (_shared/canonical-value-schemas.ts pieceShape) and the dice limits from core/dice.ts. Same limits, same messages.
// 2026-10-27, scene state (ChatStore rule 17, phase 1 of the scene-state plan): migration 43 (migration-43-scene-state.ts, new, pinned here) adds the sealed tables swipe_deltas (what each reply
// version changed, keyed by swipe id, never changed once written), message_deltas (what a message carries whichever version shows, keyed by message id and copied by a fork), branch_base (what a take starts with, an import's variables: data, copied by a fork), state_keyframes and branch_state (caches: the state after every 50th shown message and after the tip), and the sealed nullable
// turn_checkpoints.deltas_json (a turn's pending deltas). row-fingerprints.ts covers them (turn_checkpoints spec v2, so a v1 fingerprint is adopted, not flagged); the health check and the snapshot lists carry them.
// src/core/scene-state/types.ts (new, pinned here) is the stored delta and state shape. The ChatStore contract drops `variables` and `changeVariables` for `sceneState`, `sceneStateBefore` and `recordDeltas`, and the
// macro variables become the `vars` slot. ADDITIVE for the schema: no table or column an older build uses changes. ONE-WAY for the file: a build from before migration 43 refuses a database that has it (database.ts, "which this
// version does not know"), as for any new migration. The variables themselves are not carried over: branch_variables stays in the schema, no longer read or written, and nothing is moved out of
// it (Bunzai has no stored scenes to carry). No SCHEMA_BUMPS entry. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-27, trackers (section I of the scene-state plan, backend only): a new kind (src/entities/tracker/, a new decoder: name, description, a record or list layout, one to twelve typed fields with
// an optional range and default that must fit, a note, an optional macro template; shape only, no code), and a scene's prompting gains `trackers`, the library trackers it links (ids, at most 20). Scene state gains
// two slot FAMILIES, tracker-record:<pieceId> and tracker-list:<pieceId> (src/core/scene-state/slots/, new; types.ts, pinned here, only documents that a slot id may end in :*): the stored delta shape is unchanged,
// its slot is now any id a family covers. ADDITIVE: every stored piece, delta and scene reads as before. ONE-WAY: an older build has no tracker kind, refuses prompting that carries `trackers`, and drops
// the deltas of a family slot it does not know. The tool decoder's text moved into src/entities/_shared/field-schema.ts (new, pinned here: the name rule, type list and choices rule a tool's argument and a
// tracker's field share); the tool's stored shape is UNCHANGED (same keys, limits, messages, order; the tool tests and the field docs are untouched by it). The pin was recomputed for these files.
// 2026-10-27, limits rework (owner rule: no arbitrary limits people cannot control): every product limit of this session's decoders became a hostile-input ceiling from
// src/entities/_shared/sanity.ts (new, pinned here: SANITY_LIST 10,000 items, SANITY_TEXT 1,000,000 characters, SANITY_NUMBER the largest safe integer). Dice (rows, row text, weight, notation, count and
// sides), tool (fields, choices, descriptions, ids), formula (text), tracker (fields, note, template, range) and the shared piece name and description (_shared/canonical-value-schemas.ts) are
// bounded only by them; a field name keeps the providers' 64-character function-name rule. The stored SHAPE is unchanged (same keys, same optionality); values the old limits refused are now accepted
// (ADDITIVE; an older build refuses such a piece, so ONE-WAY in that sense only). Trackers also moved what a default must fit into src/entities/_shared/field-value.ts (new, pinned here; the decoder no
// longer imports the core), and src/core/dice.ts is pinned because it decides which dice notation a dice piece may hold. The delta size cap (DELTA_MAX_BYTES) is gone from the scene-state types
// (src/core/scene-state/types.ts, pinned here); the stored delta shape is unchanged. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-27 (second fix round): src/studio/settings-shape.ts (pinned here) gains two known setting KEYS, scenes.toolBudgetMs and scenes.promptBudgetMs (the time budgets of a reply's tool calls and of a prompt build's macros; settings
// are an open record, absent means the default, so no stored value changes meaning). ADDITIVE; an older build ignores the keys. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-27 (third fix round): a dice table's weights must add up to at most SANITY_NUMBER (src/entities/dice/runtime-schema.ts, pinned here), so the pick is an exact whole-number draw; core/dice.ts (pinned here) holds a die at its sides. A table whose weights add up past
// the largest safe integer is no longer read (such a piece could not roll exactly); no stored shape changes. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28, piece UI step 1 (tracker backend): the tracker body gains optional `icon` and `changes` ("chips" | "card" | "toast" | "hidden", absent means chips) and a tracker field gains optional
// `icon` and `maxField` (the name of another number field of the same tracker whose current value is its top; refused when missing, not a number, itself, in a loop, or together with `max`), all in
// src/entities/tracker/runtime-schema.ts. An icon is accepted only when it is a key of the generated glyph table, so src/entities/_shared/icon-id.ts (new, the one check) is pinned. The table itself (src/generated/ic-glyphs.json) is NOT pinned, because every
// new glyph in the UI changes it: adding one is safe, but DROPPING one later makes a stored tracker that uses it fail the decoder, so a removal needs a review of what stored pieces name. field-value.ts (pinned) gains the settling of a top taken from another field and clamps a number default to its range. ADDITIVE: no key is removed or reshaped, absent means
// the old meaning, and a piece without the new keys decodes as before (an older build refuses a piece that has them, so ONE-WAY in that sense only). The scene's `trackerChanges` switch lives in the
// prompting cell (not pinned here, an open record: absent means on, only false is kept). The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28 (fix round): the icon id is no longer checked against the glyph table. src/entities/_shared/icon-id.ts (pinned) now accepts any well-formed id (the generator's own shape, lucide: or mdi: then
// lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, at most SANITY_TEXT long) and imports no UI table; the schema type is a string. A piece naming a glyph this build lacks therefore still decodes (it is the UI that draws
// only known ids), which removes the risk that dropping a glyph makes stored trackers undecodable. field-value.ts (pinned): a number's min now wins over a top that sits below it. ADDITIVE and
// COMPATIBLE (a previously accepted piece is still accepted). The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28, piece UI step 3 (scene side): a stored reply's generation gains optional `outOfTime`, a list of `{ macro }` naming the macros a prompt build's time budget stopped while the reply was built
// (core/assembly/macro-report.ts outOfTimeOf; absent when none did, an empty list or any other key is refused), checked in src/stage/store/generation-rules.ts, which is pinned here from now on because it decides
// what a swipe's generation may hold. ADDITIVE: no key is removed or reshaped, absent means none ran out, and a reply without it reads as before (an older build refuses a reply that has it, so ONE-WAY in that
// sense only). src/studio/settings-shape.ts (pinned) only had two comments reworded (the budget keys now have a screen); no key changed. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28 (review fixes): generation-rules.ts (pinned) now refuses an outOfTime list past SANITY_LIST entries or a name past SANITY_TEXT characters as unusually large (a hostile-input ceiling, same family as the entity decoders); no stored key or shape changed, and a value that was accepted and is not past a ceiling is still accepted. settings-shape.ts (pinned) gains the shared reader budgetMsOf and MS_PER_SECOND (no key changed). The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28, the chat summary on scene state (phase 2): migration 44 (migration-44-version-writes.ts, new, pinned here) adds the nullable message_deltas.swipe_id (null is a person's edit of a message; a swipe id is a write made after a commit that names the version it is about, kept with THIS take's message so it is copied by a fork with the message-id remap and never appended to the version's shared swipe_deltas); row-fingerprints.ts (pinned) bumps message_deltas to spec v2 for the column. core/scene-state/types.ts (pinned) gains an optional slot `shape`, and scene-state-rules.ts (pinned from now on, it decides what a stored delta may hold) checks a delta's value against it; the `summary` slot's row shape (core/summary/row-shape.ts, pinned) is the first. The old per-take text in chats.summary_json is no longer read (no data carries over). ADDITIVE for the column; an older build ignores it. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28, the Props trackers on scene state (phase 3): a module's STATE leaves chats.trackers_json for the scene-state slot tracker.<module> (one slot per module that keeps state, made from the module table; a
// module with a list keeps one wrapper row {key, value} per list row and per other field, a module without keeps one field per delta; src/core/trackers/state.ts, new, pinned here). The cell now holds SETTINGS only:
// context, auto, the new subs (the sub-feature switches, moved out of the module's data), and a Storyboard's profile as data (src/stage/contracts/chat-tracker-types.ts and src/stage/store/tracker-rules.ts, pinned here from now on, because
// they decide what the cell may hold). The Director's update, undone and parked records leave the cell, and the Director snapshot loses trackerUpdates (director-rules.ts refuses it). A scene-state slot may declare shapeAt (a fields slot whose
// fields differ in kind), and a keyed-list row must carry the key its path names (src/core/scene-state/types.ts and src/stage/store/scene-state-rules.ts, pinned). NO schema change and no migration: no table or column changes. A cell written before
// this change is read as settings alone (its state, update, undone and parked keys are not read and the next change drops them); existing scenes' tracker state is NOT moved (Bunzai has no stored scenes to carry). ONE-WAY in the sense that an older
// build reads a new cell's settings but finds no state in it. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28 (phase 3 review fixes): src/core/trackers/state.ts (pinned) gains the read-side repair of a module's stored state (repairOf: keep every field and row that fits, bring a broken cross-field rule inside, the stored values unchanged). No stored key or
// shape changes: it decides only how a stored state is READ, so a state a cut left inconsistent no longer reads as the defaults. COMPATIBLE. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28, global variables on scene state (phase 4): the library's globals leave the StateStore `variables` document (no longer read or written; nothing is moved out of
// it, no data carries over) for operations in the new shared slot `global` (core/scene-state/slots/global.ts), stored as rows of swipe_deltas with the version that made them,
// so the existing sealing, snapshot, fingerprint, fork and cut handling covers them. core/scene-state/types.ts (pinned) widens SlotDef.scope to "scene" | "shared"; a take's
// fold skips a shared slot. Migration 45 (migration-45-global-ops.ts) adds only a partial index on that slot. ADDITIVE: an older build ignores the slot's rows. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28 (phase 4 review fixes): scene-state-rules.ts (pinned) re-exports GLOBAL_SLOT for the backends; a stored global row records the operation as the macro or lore Side Effect made it. No stored key changes. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28, permissions for scene state (phase 5): core/scene-state/types.ts (pinned) gains SlotWriter (turn, background, person, import; no extension writer until an extension runtime exists) and SlotDef.writers, and scene-state-rules.ts (pinned) refuses a delta whose slot does not name the writer of the door it came through (a turn's checkpoint, recordDeltas, recordMessageDeltas, setBranchBase). No stored key or shape changes. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-28, one ceiling on opening a piece: the cold-read budget is SANITY_PIECE_BYTES (entities/_shared/sanity.ts) on every read path, and the separate caps on parts (1,000 in process, 20,000 in the worker), references and JSON values are gone (each is charged against the budget). DocumentBackend.livePartsBounded takes only the charge. No stored key or shape changes. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-29, the Skill kind: a new kind folder, so a new decoder (src/entities/skill/runtime-schema.ts, the 16th runtime-schema) and a new member of the generated kind-schemas union; the lorebook decoder only exports its trigger and selective-logic schemas for the skill decoder to share (no lorebook shape changes); a new scene-state slot `skills` (a fields slot, writers turn and person) stored like every slot. ADDITIVE: an older build has no skill folder and ignores the slot. No migration. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-29: src/core/trackers/state.ts (pinned) reads a module's stored object through the shared recOr instead of its own copy. Same value read, no stored key or shape changes. COMPATIBLE. The pin was recomputed.
// 2026-10-29, co-developer Dramaturg intake: migration 46 adds the sealed, revision-guarded per-scene conversation.
// Existing migrations 43 through 45 are unchanged. The new types and strict record decoder are pinned;
// damaged records fail closed without replacing their cell. Older builds refuse the unknown migration.
// 2026-10-30: the checked nullable settings merge has one shared owner, settings-patch.ts (now pinned).
// COMPATIBLE extraction: Director/Summary retain references and undefined-empty behavior;
// Dramaturg still clones supplied values. Memory/SQLite contract and damaged-record tests pass.
// 2026-10-30: Promptbook and Agent add two kind decoders; Skill primaryLogic is optional (absent means any).
// Existing pieces remain readable. Older builds cannot read new kinds. Final Cut active saved Agents move
// to canonical pieces with complete original escrow, verified exact identity and revision-guarded edits.
// Downgrade remains one-way for those new pieces; the existing v0.1.42 storage-change fence covers this release.
// 2026-10-31: migration 47 adds sealed external rp-core session/entry tables and links.
// Migrations 1-46 retain their identities; existing scenes stay on the legacy engine.
// An older build refuses a database at migration 47, as for every unknown migration.
// The submodule commit and record-store representation pin the new journal format.
