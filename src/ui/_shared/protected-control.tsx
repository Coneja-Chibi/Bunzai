/**
 * protect(): the inline form of the protected layer, for a control that spends money, reaches the network, runs a program or
 * destroys data (the closed list below, drawn with `protect(id)` on an element (on a wrapper `div` for a group), mirrored and docs/reference/extending/make-a-theme.md). It is a
 * `.host-protected` wrapper: mod selectors are scoped off it, the host palette and type pin apply, and the watchdog guards it.
 * A modal prompt uses ProtectedDialog instead; this is for a control that must stay in its row. The list is the only place the
 * set is named, so a new protected control is one more line here, and protected-set.test.ts checks that each is drawn in the layer.
