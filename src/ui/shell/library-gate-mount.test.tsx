/**
 * LibraryGate mounted for real (perf(idle) d2071d2's review gap #1): a pushed lock event, a stream

 * proofs cannot see that wiring at all, by their own admission (see the comment there this file
 * closes). Modeled on App.boot.test.tsx's shape (a real async fetch, IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT off,
 * polling rather than act()) and use-studio-changes.test.tsx's fake EventSource.
