 * (the wings around the chat) or Messenger (DiscordChrome.tsx). Studio-wide, saved in the app preferences; unset until the
 * chooser saves it, so a scene opened before then shows the chooser instead of the chat. A saved value Bunzai cannot read is
 * treated as unset (the chooser asks again) rather than guessed.
