/**
 * The API door list: `apiFetch` and `apiFetchJson` (the session-token fetch to the local server) may be imported only by src/ui/api.ts,
 * the shell, the shared plumbing, and the files listed here, each with its reason. A scene or app file reaches the server through
 * `ctx.api` (src/ui/app-contract.ts), so the contract names every call, a fake can stand in for it in a test, and a call cannot
 * slip in beside it (Spotify and the gallery's adopt did, until they moved onto the contract). Same shape and rules as
 * src/stream-doors.test.ts.
