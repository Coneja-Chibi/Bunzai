/**
 * The shape both OS-keychain backends share (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service): one random
 * 256-bit key lives in the operating system's secret store, and every seal is AES-256-GCM under it
 * (the shared aes.ts). The key never touches Bunraku's own files, which is what makes these stronger
 * than identity-file, and it is passed to the OS tool over stdin, never as an argument, so it never
 * shows in a process listing (the DPAPI backend's rule).
 *
 * Making the key is the dangerous moment: a second key replacing the first would strand everything
 * sealed under the first (the encryption reviews' blockers). So:
 * - creation happens once per process at a time, and across processes under a lock file whose
 *   holder writes its own token, keeps it fresh with a heartbeat, and only ever removes its own lock;
 *   a stale lock is moved aside by one atomic rename and checked after the move, so a fresh lock that
 *   replaced it meanwhile is put back, never taken; the holder re-checks the lock just before it
 *   writes the key;
 * - a "key made" marker lives in the OS store next to the key, not in a Bunraku folder, so every
 *   Bunraku home on the machine sees it, and wiping the keyring clears both;
 * - before making a key, the marker is written and read back, which proves the store is unlocked
 *   and writable; a store that answers "no key" while the marker exists is refused, never replaced;
 * - after the marker is written the key is looked up again, because a locked Linux keyring can
 *   answer "no key" until that write unlocks it.
 *
 * Only reading and creating items differ per platform, so each platform file supplies just that.
