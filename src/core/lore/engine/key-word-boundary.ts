/**
 * The one definition of a "word character" for whole-word lore key matching, shared by
 * triggers-keyword.ts (regex lookarounds) and key-index.ts (per-character check) so the two paths
 * can never disagree. A word character is a Unicode letter, number, combining mark, or underscore,
 * so a Cyrillic, Greek, or accented key matches only at real word edges. Characters of scripts
 * written without spaces (Han, Hiragana, Katakana, Thai) are NOT word characters: they were never
 * word characters under the old ASCII `\W` rule either, so a CJK whole-word key keeps matching
 * inside running text exactly as before. ASCII is unchanged: [A-Za-z0-9_] are word characters,
 * everything else (apostrophes, hyphens, spaces) is a boundary.
