/**
 * `makeSlotOf`: the lookup from a slot id to its declaration over the declared slots. An exact id wins; otherwise a family
 * (`tracker-record:*`) covers every id that starts with its prefix and has a member part of 1 to 120 characters, so the store never
 * sees library pieces: it asks for a slot and gets the family's rules. Two families whose prefixes overlap, or one declared twice, are
 * refused at build, so no id can match two.
