/**
 * The Story Director's tracker round (plan 16; RoleCall `runDM.ts` phase 3b, 1074-1131): after a reply, one request for the legacy trackers that are on and due, answered as an UPDATE
 * of what each keeps. Pure: studio/scene-director-trackers.ts sends it and writes; nothing here touches the scene. It reuses the refresh code's module specs (core/trackers/refresh.ts), so a
 * module's identity, stacking and leader rules stay with the module.
 *
 * Differences from RoleCall and from Refresh, each deliberate (plans 13 and 16):
 *  - it runs on the exchange that just happened (RoleCall's runs before the reply, so it tracks the previous reply's prose, map 13 #15);
 *  - an answer never removes by omission: entries it leaves out stay, and a name in `remove` takes an entry out the way the module takes one out (a mark, never a delete);
 *  - an answer that cannot be read, or does not fit the module, changes nothing and says why.

Under each name, use that tracker's format but give only the entries that changed or are new, and only the values that changed; everything you leave out stays exactly as it is.
