/**
 * Refresh from chat history for a whole tracker module (RoleCall `app/api/chat/initialize-trackers/route.ts`: `buildAnalysisPrompt` 162-319, the system line at 428): the
 * request the scene's model gets, how its answer becomes a proposed next state, and what that state changes. Pure: studio/scene-tracker-refresh.ts sends it; nothing here
 * writes the scene. The proposal is the module's own state after its own actions (refresh, add, remove), so identity, stacking and the leader rule stay with the module.
 *
 * Differences from RoleCall, each deliberate (14-tracker-refresh-rc-map.md section 4):
 *  - the prompt carries the tracker as it is now, so the model updates it instead of re-initialising it from the tail;
 *  - an answer that cannot be read is an error, never defaults (RoleCall resets HP, combat and corruption on a provider failure);
 *  - rows are matched by name, a row the answer leaves out is marked removed (Undo brings it back), and the person sees all of it before accepting;
 *  - the prompt text drops "still include it with empty/default values" and the Creature Codex line that invents species when none have appeared.
