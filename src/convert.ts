/**
 * The bundle/link layer that sits above the single-entity adapters: a card is not just a character,
 * it may bundle an embedded lorebook. Converting one end to end means reading the character, pulling
 * any embedded character_book out as a linked canonical Lorebook (knowledgeRefs), then writing the
 * target - re-embedding that lorebook into the target format's own book slot.
 *
 * This is where "extract at the boundary" (import) meets "inline at the boundary" (export): the
 * extraction is format-agnostic (any CCv2/v3 card), the re-embed is the target adapter's job via the
 * EmitContext it receives. Lives here, at the app layer that already wires adapters together, never
 * in the inward-pointing core. Studio inspect/export must compose the same service as the CLI.
