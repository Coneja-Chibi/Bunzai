/**
 * Bunraku.exe - the desktop entry. Compiled by scripts/build-desktop.ts (bun build --compile).
 * Real software: OUR process opens a native WebView2 window (webview-bun, MIT, the OS's own
 * webview - no browser dependency, no Electron), so the window and taskbar wear the bunny-b icon
 * baked into this exe. The server owns the MAIN thread; the window's blocking message pump lives
 * in a worker (it starves the event loop otherwise - verified). Window closes -> studio exits.
 *
 * Every failure path here is REPORTED rather than swallowed - see desktop-boot-report.ts. The exe hides
 * its console, so anything that throws on the way up is otherwise invisible to the person who launched
 * it.
