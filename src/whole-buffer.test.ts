/**
 * The whole-buffer list: every source file that reads user data
 * into one buffer or string is named here with the exact number of such calls, the ceiling that bounds
 * it, and the reason it is allowed. A new call in a new file fails until it is listed with a reason; a
 * new call in a listed file fails until its count is raised on purpose; a file that stops calling must
 * be lowered or removed, so the list cannot rot. Seeded with today's exact counts (S0).
 *
 * A ceiling is a number of MiB, or one of: "codec" (pure encoder, the caller carries the bound),
 * "unbounded" and "unverified" (debt: the plan's streaming slices exist to remove these).
 *
 * Banned unless listed: .arrayBuffer(), Buffer.concat(, readFile(Sync)(, .text(), new Uint8Array(await,
 * bytesToBase64(, base64ToBytes(, zipSync(, unzipSync(, unzipBounded(, readAsDataURL(. Test code, test
 * stand-ins and fixtures are not scanned. This is a static check of those spellings; it cannot see a
 * whole-buffer read made through some other API (the plan's rows 10, 11 and 14 are such reads).
