/**
 * The reply's request, built once, split out of scene-turn.ts for its file-size cap and so the Context wing's Next send forecast
 * (scene-forecast.ts) is the very code a send runs, not a second assembly path that has to be kept in step with it. `prepareRequest` reads what assembly needs (the scene's
 * window, request options, meter and variables); `assembleRequest` runs the assembler over the loaded scene; `shapeRequest` fits the result to one model (prefill, the
 * continue cue, last-as-user, reasoning continuity, the person's edits). Nothing here writes, sends or asks a model: the turn does that, in its own order.
