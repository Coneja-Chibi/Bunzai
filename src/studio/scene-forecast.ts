/**
 * The Next send forecast (rc-parity 08, slice 5; RoleCall's `PromptPreviewPanel` over `api/chat/preview-prompt`): the request the scene would send if the person sent this
 * message now. It is the reply turn's own build (scene-turn-build.ts: prepare, assemble, shape) run over the loaded scene with the draft as the message being answered, so
 * it cannot drift from a send the way RoleCall's second assembly path does. It writes nothing (no checkpoint, no variable, no meter lesson), asks no model, and says what it leaves
 * out: the Compendium's recall is a model call that only a real send makes, and a scene's prompt regex runs in the page's sandbox worker during a send.
