/**
 * Collections store - atomic write; missing file = none; corrupt file = none rather than a throw.
 *
 * Deliberately a SIBLING of SettingsStore rather than a key inside it. Settings are preferences the
 * shell owns and every read of them is cheap; collections are studio content that grows with the
 * folder, and hanging membership lists off the preferences schema would mean rewriting somebody's
 * theme and accent every time they dragged a piece into a group.
 *
 * MISSING AND CORRUPT ARE BOTH "NO COLLECTIONS", which is the one place this differs from settings.
 * Settings throws on a corrupt file because starting with the wrong theme is better than starting
 * with a lie about what somebody configured. Collections are additive: nothing in the studio depends
 * on them, so refusing to open the app over a bad grouping file would take the whole library down
 * for a feature the person could simply rebuild. The parser is fail-closed per collection anyway, so
 * the total loss case is a file that is not JSON at all.
