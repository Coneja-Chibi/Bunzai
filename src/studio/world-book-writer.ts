/**
 * The one writer of a lorebook for the Compendium: filing, Undo and
 * Reconcile all change a book here and nowhere else. A caller hands over a pure edit of the book's entries; the writer reads the
 * book once, applies the edit, sends only the entries that changed as one revision-checked patch through the same
 * `buildPiecePatch` the World wing's Lorebook tab saves with, and never writes an unversioned book. Books are written one at a
 * time (a queue per book), so two passes cannot race each other in this process; the person editing at the same moment can,
 * and then the book is read again once: if every entry the edit touched is exactly as it was, the edit is applied to the fresh
 * book and sent again, and otherwise nothing is written and the touched entries are reported (F4: no loop, no half write).
