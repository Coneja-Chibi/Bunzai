/**
 * The one write the Historian and Import chat history share: a parsed answer of entries, recaps and plot overviews becomes one
 * revision-checked patch to one book through the book writer, and the receipt writes that undo it. Recaps get their range stamped and
 * a plot made for any plot they name that the book lacks; an overview is written only for a plot some recap of this write names.
 * Items the book refuses are reported alone; a book edited under the write is not written at all and says so.
