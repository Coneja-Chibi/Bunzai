/**
 * Undo of a filing or mirror receipt (04b D7, F4): a guarded reverse patch per entry from the receipt's field-level values, sent
 * through the one book writer. An entry changed since the pass is skipped and listed (RoleCall's conflict rule), a created entry
 * is retired and never deleted, an entry already as it was or gone is nothing to do and not an error, and the original receipt
 * is marked `undone` only after every patch has landed; a partial or failed undo leaves it `filed` so the person can try again.
 * The undo is its own receipt, so Activity shows it. Callers run these in the scene's lane (`compendium-queue.ts`).
