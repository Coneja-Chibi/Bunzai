/**
 * Bunraku (dev) - the native desktop window over the LIVE source. Same WebView2 window as Bunraku.exe,
 * but it never bakes a snapshot: it discovers formats from src/formats and serves the UI straight
 * from src/ui, hot-reloading every open page on edit. So it is ALWAYS current - no compile, no
 * re-snapshot, ever. Run on your own dev machine (Bun + this source tree present):
 *   bun run src/desktop-dev.ts
 * A Start Menu shortcut launches exactly this, so the search-bar "Bunraku" opens today's code.
 *
 * The shipped Bunraku.exe (scripts/build-desktop.ts) stays the baked build - a frozen release a user
 * can run without Bun or the source. This dev entry is its live-source twin, for us only.
