 * The documents it holds. A closed list: a new one is a deliberate addition, never a free string.

 * token meter's learned numbers per model: numbers only.
 * `guides` is the guide library (studio/guides.ts): RoleCall's guided responses, which no piece kind fits.
 * `loadouts` is the saved scene setups and their undo receipts (studio/loadouts.ts), kept like guides.
 * `finalCut` is the person's own Anti-Slop banks and saved Custom Agents (studio/final-cut-library.ts), kept like guides.
