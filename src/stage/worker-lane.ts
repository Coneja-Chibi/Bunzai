/**
 * The background lane's one runner (Performance): heavy work runs on a
 * worker thread so the app's main thread never freezes behind it. It starts a worker, sends one job,
 * resolves with the worker's answer, and ends the worker. A worker that cannot start, dies, or runs
 * past its time is a failed job with a reason; the runner never throws and never falls back to
 * doing the work on the main thread itself.
 *
 * Today's workers: the database rebuild (store/sqlite/maintenance-worker.ts) and the password lock
 * (crypto/password-worker.ts).
 *
 * PACKAGING: in a compiled executable a worker must be started from a plain string literal that
 * matches an extra build entrypoint, relative to the build root (src/); a computed URL compiles and
 * then fails at runtime (the v0.1.0 release shipped exactly that for the desktop window). Source runs
 * resolve the file by URL. `store/sqlite/lane-probe.ts` is the packaged probe for both lane workers;
 * this source revision has not been compiled or probed.
