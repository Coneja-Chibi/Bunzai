/**
 * The egress-door list: a bare `fetch(` or a node:http(s) import may
 * appear only in the files listed here, each with its exact call count and its reason. A URL a person types never goes to
 * `fetch(` directly: it goes through `guardedFetchVetted` in src/kit/providers/egress.ts, which resolves once, refuses any
 * non-public address, pins the connection to the vetted address, re-vets every redirect hop and caps time and size. Every
 * other listed call has a fixed host, a loopback address, or the studio's own origin. Same shape and rules as
 * src/stream-doors.test.ts and src/disk-writes.test.ts.
